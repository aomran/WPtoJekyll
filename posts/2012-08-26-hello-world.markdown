Well I've finally decided to use this online space properly and put a blog on it. Whether I actually start to blog regularly will be interesting to see. Right now I am busy with many projects but I think I can find the time to blog every now and then :)

Another piece of news is that I just moved the websites that I maintain to a new server, everything is now hosted on [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com "Dream Host"). I'm hoping that this host will satisfy my needs, I really don't want to look around for another web-host. They do sound promising though so we'll see what happens. If for some reason you want to try dreamhost then use my $50 coupon "AOMRAN" (we might as well both benefit from this, I get about $60 for you signing up and you save some money).

In the next few hours I'll be updating the website design with a beautiful Wordpress theme from a [German web designer](http://www.elmastudio.de/ "German web designer") and installing some plugins so that everything runs smoothly on this blog. I would have designed the website myself but getting exactly what I want (minimalistic, responsive, and properly coded) would take me weeks. I'm taking the easy way out so that I have time for the projects that I'm working on.

I'll tell you more about what I'm doing later.

Cheers
