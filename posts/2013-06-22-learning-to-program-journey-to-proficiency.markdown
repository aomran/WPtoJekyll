I created my first website in 1998, during the days of Geocities, Tripod and and Angelfire. For more than a decade after that, I learned many marketable skills thanks to the culture of open source and sharing in the hacker community.

One skill that I never really learned was computer programming. Still, as a [freelance web developer ](http://www.chrysaliswebsolutions.com "Chrysalis Web Solutions")I was able to offer services such as SEO, Design/HTML/CSS, databases, deployment, troubleshooting and back-end development using open source PHP apps like Wordpress. It is surprising how much one can do without knowing too much about software development.

For many years I had the realization that I could be "dangerous" once I learned to program. The desire was there but my focus was on higher priorities - my formal education (science degree and then an education degree) and my freelance work.

A unique opportunity to learn programming presented itself during the fall of 2012. Top quality university computer science courses were made available through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ "Coursera"). These courses started me on a journey into the software development world.

The [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition "Dreyfus model of skill acquisition") is a good way of modelling my journey. The model suggests that learners go through five distinct stages when acquiring new skills.
# Novice Stage - *“OMG my computer knows math”*
[Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1 "Learn to program course") and [An Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython "Interactive python class") were instrumental in taking me from novice to advanced beginner. The courses were perfect for novices because instructions were clear, rules/recipes were given, there was close monitoring (deadlines for assignments, marks, quizzes, a lot of interactivity with the teachers). The coding environment was simple to set up.

I learned fundamentals: how programs work, memory, variables, built-in functions, types, defining functions, flow (conditionals, loops), mutability, etc.

[Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/ "Code School") (Try Ruby &amp; Try Git) and [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/ "Codecademy") (Python, Ruby and Javascript tracks) were great places to get practice and apply the rules/recipes that I learned to other contexts. At this stage, getting acquainted with any other programming language became easy because patterns started to emerge. I realized that the rules and recipes that I learned can also be applied to other contexts. It became just a matter of learning syntax differences.
# Advanced Beginner Stage - *“Getting out of the sandbox”*
To go to the next stage I needed to get out of the "sandbox" so to speak and get experience dealing with "real world" situations. The first chapter of [Michael Hartel's Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#top "Rails Tutorial book") book was a good start because I was taught to install RVM/Ruby/Rails and use the terminal and Git to deploy a Rails app to Heroku. Next I completed the [Rails for Zombies Redux](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux "Rails for zombies redux") course but I insisted on creating a “real app” and not just being content with the online exercises. To add authentication and authorization to the app I followed the screen casts from [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/ "Rails Casts"). I also completed the jQuery Air course (now [Try jQuery](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery "Try jQuery - new version of jQuery air")) to get some practice with Javascript.

At this point I felt excited but pretty confused as well. There was a lot of stuff that I didn't understand. Still I built my first app (twitter clone) with authentication and authorization and a dash of Javascript so I started to feel competent.
# Competent Stage - *“Time to dive into the details”*
Work was a bit overwhelming at this point in the year; I had 30-40 students and we were preparing for the Ministry of Education inspection. So Christmas was a much needed break; I got two weeks to relax and complete some Code School courses. I completed Ruby courses ([Rails for Zombies 2](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-2 "Rails for zombies 2"), [Ruby Bits](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits "Ruby Bits"), [Rails Best Practices](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-best-practices "Rails best practices")), [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real "Git real"), and JS courses ([Coffeescript](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/coffeescript "Coffeescript"), [jQuery Captain's Log](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-air-captains-log "Captain's log - jQuery air"), [Anatomy of Backbone](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs "Backbonejs")).

In January I signed up and completed [CS169.1](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/cs169-1x/software-service/691/ "Saas course") (Saas course from edX) and [Introduction to Databases](https://class2go.stanford.edu/db/Winter2013/preview/ "Intro to databases") (Stanford's class2go). A big picture started to form, relationships became clear and some misconceptions were replaced with solid understanding. However, rules started to pile up so it was pivotal that I start to organize knowledge and form patterns that are easier to remember.

In order to build a better conceptual model of software development, I found it necessary to get more practice and learn more real world programming concepts (such as BDD/TDD). So I completed the following:

* Built shopping cart app by following “[Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4 "Agile Rails Book")” book
* Completed Code School courses: [Ruby Bits 2](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits-part-2 "Ruby bits 2"), [Testing with Rspec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec "Testing with rspec") &amp; [Rails Testing for Zombies](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-testing-for-zombies "Rails testing for zombies").
* Read [Rspec book](http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book "Rspec Book") and completed the hands-on tutorial
* Completed [BDD Tuts-premium course](https://tutsplus.com/course/bdd-rails-application/ "BDD Rails")

I took the time to learn more about the Ruby environment (Rack, Rake, RubyGems, Bundler) a few weeks ago, which helped me form connections. I used this knowledge to play around with the Jekyll and Sinatra gems.

At this point, I feel that Ruby makes more sense, now that I have a better understanding of OOP, metaprogramming, and the Ruby object model. BDD also makes more sense; I am able to write a Cucumber feature and use it to write Rspec specs and Ruby code. The past week or two, I took some time off to review/learn [HTML5/CSS3](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/functional-html5-css3 "HTML5CSS3"), [Mobile First Design, Responsive Design](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/journey-into-mobile "Journey into Mobile"), and [Sass](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass "Sass")/[Compass](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass-part-2 "Sass part 2") thanks to Code School and [some books](http://www.abookapart.com/ "A book apart").

It's hard to say whether I am a "competent" developer at this point but I certainly know a great deal about the whole development stack and I have years of experience in web design/development. At any rate I will feel more "competent" once I organize my notes because they will help me form a framework around my skills/knowledge.

The real test of competency will be building a unique app from scratch. Fortunately, I already have a freelance project to work on that fits the bill. [Voix Visuelle](http://voixvisuelle.ca/en/ "Voix Visuelle") (long-term client) is an artists' center that has requested a Rails app to automate art submissions. I will be working closely with my wife, Paula Franzini, to complete this project, as she is the technical liaison.
# Proficient Stage - *"Harder than it looks"*
The software development knowledge and skills that I possess come almost exclusively from self-directed learning. For this reason, I felt that a formal approach ([HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com/ "HackerYou")'s Summer Academy) will help patch up some rough spots. The HackerYou program will be great because I am taking two months off (less work, less distractions) to really be immersed in software development. The program will be an opportunity to meet people who are in a similar situation and hopefully reciprocate some knowledge/skills/experiences.

I'm looking forward to a lot of practice this summer to build my intuition (knowledge and experience to tap into). To reach “proficient” status I will need to keep practicing and learning concepts such as:
* OOP design concepts, more metaprogramming, Ruby object model
* Best practices: scalability, maintainability, BDD/TDD, monitoring, performance tuning
* SASS / multitenancy
* Unix, VMs, VPS, AWS, Chef/Capistrano
* Teamwork: Deploy app as team, continuous integration, collaborate with Git
* Hacker Culture: open source, sharing/exchange of info, community/collaboration

# Expert Stage - *“10 years later?”*
This will hopefully come with time, lots of passion and lots of hard work.
